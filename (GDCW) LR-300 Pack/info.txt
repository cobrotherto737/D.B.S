[b]Notes: [/b]
-You might need CS:S for this to work 
-Thses are sweps, the gloves, map, and hud are not included. If you want them you will have to get them yourself. 
-The screenshots are using post processing effects. 
-These sweps are using a new base so they are in beta stages. The changes to the base include not being able to fire underwater which could cause huge amounts of lag and fps drops. Another change is you now option to adjust how much dirt is kicked up when the bullet impacts. Perfect for those playing with slower computers or those that just want to ramp up the dirt. 
-To change the amount of dirt kick up on bullet impact go to options from the spawn menu, then GDCW settings then performance. Draging the slider will adjust the amounts of effects (default is 1). If you want the impact effects completely disabled set it to 0.
