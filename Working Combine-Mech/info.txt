*QUICK FIXES*

My Mech keeps falling and i cant get up. 
      FIX- Make sure your sv_gravity is at a reasonable number or you wont be able to move.

*KNOWN BUGS* 

When you leave the combine mech you will be purple. Only way to fix it so far is to kill yourself and you will be back to normal. I will fix this sooner or later."
