Tool Originally made by Dunk and Re-built from the ground up by Hans Leid 

With this tool all you have to do is select every prop once and they all will be welded to each other so make one sturdy good weld. You can also have it auto-select near by props or have all the props welded to on item. 

You can find a mirror link to this tool here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/1n6z163rfpl6a59/Smart_Weld_4.3.zip

If you would rather use my old version 3.5 it can be found here (may be broken idk): http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?x4qy4o3b06u3k3v 

If the YouTube video doesn't work try here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShW4c0LSJ1M 

The original tool can be found here: http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=18508

Helpful Tip: You need either "Weld to Each Other" or "Weld to World" or both for the tool to work. I thought this was common sense but i guess not. This tool conflicts with any MadCow or mad_base guns! If I get asked enough I may fix this.

After originally posting this December 25, 2012 I thought it was missing something so that is why for my 7,000 subscriber I got this tool completely re-made and better! I regret removing the old one though but hopefully you will find that this version is much better!

The second YouTube video was Dunk's original video showing the addon back in 2007! Thought it was cool to show you guys and it sure beats my video :)
